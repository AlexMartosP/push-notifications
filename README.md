# Web push notifications
This is me testing setting up push notifications on client and server.
I try keeping it as low level as possible and not intruducing libraries that do most of the work, to learn as much as possible.

I will go through the entire process, from permisson to sending push notifications and receiving in a service worker.

Feel free to check out how Push notifications work on both sides and I will try to keep the code as clean and minimal as possible.

### Resuorces (will add more)
